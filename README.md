### A brief description of the project:

This project aims to help children understand the relationships between temperature, latitude and altitude. There are several interactive sections:

1. Tinkering
2. Information cards
3. flip cards
4. Quiz

### Notes for a teacher
The relationship between altitude, latitude and temperature, as well as the reason for that, is more complicated than what is represented on this website. This website serves as a supplement to informal or formal geography learning. The teacher can use this website as a pre-class activity to help learners gain a basic understanding of the relationship.
